**Entities:**
- **User**: The end user interacting with the system.
- **Client Interface**: Web UI, Streamlit app, or API client.
- **MCP Server**: FastAPI server, exposing endpoints via MCP, integrating with LLM and cloud services.
- **LLM**: Large Language Model, providing AI-powered responses or automation.

---

## Implementation & Framework/SDK Usage

- **FastAPI**: Main backend framework for REST and async endpoints.
- **FastMCP SDK**: Exposes endpoints as MCP tools, enabling LLM orchestration and tool usage.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Used for intelligent automation, task execution, or chat.
- **Streamlit** (if present): For rapid UI prototyping or dashboard.
- **httpx**: For async HTTP requests to external APIs (e.g., CodeArts Pipeline).
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server to run FastAPI app.
- **requests**: For synchronous HTTP requests (if needed).
- **Authentication**: Secured via environment variable for API tokens.
- **Logging**: For monitoring and debugging.

## Explanation Points for Presentation

- Modular system: client interface can be web UI, CLI, or API consumer.
- MCP Server orchestrates business logic, integrates with LLM and cloud services.
- LLM enables automation, smart responses, and advanced features.
- Extensible and cloud-ready: new tools or endpoints can be added easily.
- Secure and scalable due to FastAPIâ€™s async nature and token-based auth.
